            <h3> 3) Privacy Policy</h3><br/>
            All information received by us from your registration on HomeServices.com or other digital products of Home Services will be used by Home Services in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Kindly read the below mentioned details.<br/><br/>
			<h3><u>Policies:</u></h3>
				<h3>Workplace Safety policy:</h3>
			Whether your business operates in a factory or a standard office complex, anyone who steps onto your property faces some level of risk.A data entry worker could develop carpal tunnel syndrome while in your employ. Your company vice president could injure himself moving a computer from one office to another. 
			By putting workplace safety policies in place, you can help mitigate any damages caused by an employee's negligence.<br/>
			<h3>Disciplinary Policies:</h3>
			Occasionally you'll have the need to terminate an employee. When that occasion arises, you'll have a much more straightforward experience if the employee has been cautioned about the process. If your expectations for performance are outlined in the employee's initial job description, you can show a history of problems by detailing those issues in regular evaluations and write-ups.<br/>
		  <h3>Device Use Policies:</h3>
			You may not realize that as an employer, you could be held responsible for the actions of those in your employ. That means if one of your workers conducts illegal activities on one of your systems, you may be answerable for it. Businesses protect themselves against liability in these instances by having a clearly written usage policy that outlines what workers can and cannot do on devices connected to your network.<br/>
			<h3>Work Hours and Turnaround Time:</h3>
			In the early days, your policies may relate more to your business processes than your team, since you won't have a robust team starting out. One important first step should relate to your availability, including your working hours. Studies show that customers prefer talking to live customer service representatives. Will you be available for calls or emergency concerns after hours or are you only available during business hours? Set those expectations up front to avoid disappointment on either end.
			<br/>
			<h3>Late Payment Policies:</h3>
			Before you do your first job, you should create a payment process for the work you'll perform. How will you invoice your clients and what forms of payment will be accepted? Set a grace period for payments to be made before a small service charge is added. Many businesses allow 30 days from the time of invoice for the payment to be made before they begin sending late payment notices.<br/>
			<h3>Return/Refund Policies:</h3>
			If your business is a retailer or e-commerce business, you should have a return policy clearly posted on your website or store signage. If you put a strict return policy in place, ask yourself whether you plan to stand firmly behind that policy or capitulate for those customers who escalate a complaint up the chain of command. Refunds are still a possibility for service-oriented businesses, even though there is no product to resell. Many businesses offer satisfaction guarantees to lure new business in. While you likely won't be able to offer a 100 percent money-back guarantee, you should consider how you'll handle things when a client or customer is dissatisfied with your work.<br/><br/><br/>
			<u><b>We will not disclose your personal information like:</b></u><br/>
			E-mail Id.<br/>
			Phone number.<br/>
			Address<br/>
			Aadhaar card number.<br/>
